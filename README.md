This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and expanded by me.

## Getting Started

First, install all the missing dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses Tailwind CSS and Typescript.

## Components

The boilerplate contains already styled and ready-to-use basic components (search bars, inputs, buttons, etc.).
The Tailwind config was expanded with my own colour pallette and some utilities (working columns auto-fit, capitalize first letter in a paragraph).
